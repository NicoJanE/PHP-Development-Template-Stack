# What
This is a template Docker development/Swarm container for PHP developers. Originally intended for my personal use, so a warning: this project may contain some additional related documentation instructions and remarks which were for my own documentation, so some subjects may be overstated. However, it may also be useful for others. It contains:


1. Debian container with: Apache, PHP, PHP-FPM(CGI gateway), PHPUnit, Codeception(***TODO  AddOn***).

1. Instructions for adding additional PHP versions

1. Instructions for creating a development container 
Use this for creating and starting a local container, for development and test work. 

1. Instructions for configuring PHP debugging (Xdebug)

1. Instructions to create an (optional) Swarm, this involves: 
-- Installing Multipass, see: https://multipass.run/ 
-- Creating multiple Virtual Machines with Multipass need for the swarm  
-- Initializing the swarm and defining the VMs as docker Manager or docker Worker
-- Making a Image required for the swarm
-- Publishing the image to a registry (Docker Hub)
-- Deploy the swarm service (pulling the image from docker hub)


# Where more information
More documents can be found in the 'Howto" directory. it contains:
1. Swarm document: open [howto_create_a_swarm.md](./Howtos/howto_create_a_swarm.md)
2. Development container document: open [howto_create_A_dev_container.md](./Howtos/howto_create_A_dev_container.md) 
3. Instructions to install and use other PHP versions: open [howto_install_other_PHP_versions](./Howtos/howto_install_other_PHP_versions.md)
4. Instructions to configure/install debugging see: [howto_steps_for_debugging.md](./Howtos/howto_steps_for_debugging.md)


# General usage suggestion
This is a Template example defined in the ***\docker\Containers and swarm templates\\*** folder. Me personal idea is to copy this directory to the local development programming language directory as an template (and customize it there when needed, it can then become a new version or a whole new template). In the copied template language directory you can then make a copy of the above defined template and implement your project from there.

Example :

|language| Copy form      | To Template Location | Project location|
|--------| -------------- | -------------------- |-----------------|
|PHP     | \docker\Create Swarm With PhpMysqlService | \Php\\_docker-template\ | \Php\Projects\ProjectX |
|Python  | \docker\Create Swarm With PyFlaskService | \Python\\_docker-template\ | \Python\Projects\ProjectY |
