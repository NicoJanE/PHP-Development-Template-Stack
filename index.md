# What
This is a template Docker development/Swarm container for PHP developers. Originally intended for my personal use, so a warning: this project may contain some additional related documentation instructions and remarks which were for my own documentation, so some subjects may be overstated. However, it may also be useful for others. It contains:


1. Debian container with: Apache, PHP, PHP-FPM (CGI gateway), PHPUnit, Codeception (***TODO  AddOn***).

1. Instructions for adding additional PHP versions

1. Instructions for creating a development container. 
Use this for creating and starting a local container, for development and test work. 

1. Instructions for configuring PHP debugging (Xdebug)

1. Instructions to create an (optional) Swarm, this involves: 
- Installing Multipass, see [Multipass](https://multipass.run/) 
- Creating multiple Virtual Machines with Multipass (needed for the swarm) 
- Initializing the swarm and defining the VMs as docker Manager or docker Worker
- Making an Image required for the swarm
- Publishing the image to a registry (Docker Hub)
- Deploy the swarm service (pulling the image from docker hub)

You can use this container to develop your PHP based application, a simple sample application is available in the directory: \ApachePHPWebService\app. Or use it to test the docker swarm functionality.

>### Personal maintenance instructions
>The template containers are **maintained** only in the **DTS**. I copy these to a project directory and customize them there for the project. If the customization is generic, I will merge it into the DTS template project
