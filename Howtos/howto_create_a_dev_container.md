# 1. Create and start a PHP developer container
This section describes how to create and start the Docker PHP container. If you want to experiment with a swarm (create, initialize, and run different containers), refer to the document: [***How to Create a Swarm***](Howto_Create_A_Swarm)

>### Docker call syntax 
<small> (***Skip this if you known docker basics***) </small><br>
**Take note: Docker calling context**
Because we use Docker files (Dockerfile and compose) with descriptive names, for example, **Dockerfile_Nodejs_React_Cont** instead of plain **Dockerfile**, this has an impact on the way Docker commands are run and called. For example, with a plain **Dockerfile**, we would use this command to call the Docker file in the **Docker Compose** file:
<br>
```
context: .
dockerfile: Dockefile
```
In our case, we cannot use the default name but have to specify the name we gave, thus:<br>
```     
build: 	    
context: .
dockerfile: Dockerfile_Nodejs_React_Cont	    
```
 The same applies for using the build command. With the default Dockerfile, you can use this:
```
 docker build 
 # This will assume a file: Dockerfile is available
```
With the named file, we have to use
```
 docker build -f MyDockerFileNameHere
```
The same applies for running the Compose file (use **-f** option)

## 1.1 The basic PHP container setup
This section creates and start the PHP container in docker Desktop.
**To Setup** creat and start the PHP container in docker Desktop execute this command from the **ApachePHPWebService**  directory:

>### Create Project from Template
>>  <small> ***Skipp this if you known how to deal with copy\customize docker files*** </small> <br>
>
> To adapt the template directory for your project, follow these steps. This guide assumes you’re using the React stack; if you’re working with a different stack (e.g., PHP, Rust), simply replace “React” with the stack name your are using.s
> 1. Copy the whole directory to your project name:
`copy "React Development Template Stack" MyReactStack` <br> <br>
> 1. within your **MyReactStack** open the ***[name]Service*** directory <br><br>
*Warning*{: style="color: red;font-size:13px; "} <small>When using multiple containers, it's a good idea to rename the directory (for example, by adding a number) before proceeding. Otherwise, the containers will be grouped together, which is generally helpful, but this can lead to caching issues in certain container stacks, such as React. These issues may manifest as the same directories appearing in the container from a previous instance after running the **compose_nodejs_react_cont.yml** command. Caching problems can be quite troublesome in some Docker stack configurations</small> <br><br>
> 3. Customize the Dockerfiles: Since most Docker Compose setups involve a parent-child relationship (i.e., chaining), a change in one Dockerfile may require updates to all related files. Follow these steps:<br><br>
3.1  In the first compose_\* file change the **services name** to an appropriate name: <br>
```services:
webserver-nodejs-react:  # Change this ```<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- sorry for this --> 	
<small> <sup>*</sup>Always use lowercase!</small> <br><br>
3.2 The above **service name** may appear more than once in the same file, update these service names as well! <br><br>
3.3 Changes the **service name**  from step 3.1 in the other **compose_\* files**  <br><br>
3.4 Check the compose_\* files when it contain a **image name** than update this to your own image name:<br>
`` build:`` <br>
``     context: .  ``<br>
``     dockerfile: Dockerfile_Nodejs_React_Cont`` <br>
``       image: eelhart/react-base:latest      `` <br>
``		# Update above. i.e: [yourname/react-prjx]`` <br><br>
3.5 This **image name** may appear in other compose_\* files and other Dockerfile_\* files, updates these image names as well.
>
> 4 Lastly, update the ports to ensure that each host port is unique across all running containers. In your Docker Compose file, you might see this configuration: <br>
``ports:`` <br>
``target: 3001        # Container port.`` <br> 
`` published: 3002    # Host port, Make SURE it is unique    `` <br>
<br><small> Alternatively, the syntax might look like this (achieving the same result): </small><br>
`` ports:`` <br>
`` - "3002:3001"      # host:container`` <br><br>
> **Make sure that Host port: 3002 is not used by any other docker container or other services on your host!**
<br> <br>
</details>

```
docker  compose -f compose_apache_php_cont.yml up -d
# To rebuild an existing container avoid caching issues, you can use:
docker-compose -f compose_apache_php_cont.yml up -d --build --force-recreate
```
### Result & running
**Test if it runnings with:**
-	[http://localhost:8071/phpinfo.php](http://localhost:8071/phpinfo.php)
-	[http://localhost:8071/index.php](http://localhost:8071/index.php) 

**Location of files in container:**
Files can be found in:
- `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/public`
- `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/public`

**mount bind location on host**
- `..\ApachePHPWebService\app`
<br><br>

## 1.2 Add PHPUnit to the image (Add-on)
Optional you can add the PHPunit test framework to the image, after executing the commands in the previous paragraph execute  this command: ( again in the **[name]Service**  directory)  
```                                       
docker  compose -f compose_UnitTest_Addon.yml up -d  --remove-orphans --build --force-recreate
```


When this is done the following commands(in the container) should return the phpunit and composer versions 

```
phpunit --version		# returns version phpunit
composer -V			# returns vcersio composer
``` 

```
# In case the phpunit --version command returns not found, do this
RUN echo 'export PATH="/root/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc \
    && . ~/.bashrc
```

### Result & running
-	[http://localhost:8071/phpinfo.php](http://localhost:8071/phpinfo.php)
-	[http://localhost:8071/index.php](http://localhost:8071/index.php) 



# 2. Develop and debug in Visual Studio Code
- Open VSC and press the docker Icon(left sidebar)
- Right Click on your container and choose "Attache Visual Studio Code" a new VSC Window opens that is mapped the container
- Choose: Open folder and select the folder ***/usr/local/apache2/htdocs***
- For debug installation/configuration see the howto file: [howto_steps_for_debugging](howto_steps_for_debugging)
