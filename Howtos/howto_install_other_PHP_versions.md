# Add other PHP versions into this container
In the docker file [../ApachePHPWebService/Dockerfile_Apache_PHP_cont](../ApachePHPWebService/Dockerfile_Apache_PHP_cont) we have include the PHP repository for other PHP versions, see the comment:
> ***'2) Include repositories for other PHP versions'*** in that file. 

The steps described in this document depend on that repository to fetch the 'other PHP' versions. Note that we also need the related **PHP fpm** package from that repository.

----

## 1. Requirements
- A running container created with the Docker compos file: **compose_apache_php_cont.yml** (which uses: 'Dockerfile_Apache_PHP_cont'). See documentation file:[how to create a development container](howto_create_A_dev_container)
- The bind mounted folders, which should already be there when you have a running container(installed with the above link).

----

## 2. Steps to install an additional PHP version
Let's assume you want to add PHP 5.6 (that's old, time to upgrade your site perhaps) to the container.
- Check if the version is in the repository
```apt-cache search php5.6```
- Install it, if the above command returns it
```apt update  && apt install -y php5.6 php5.6-fpm```
- Update the ***start.sh*** shell script, this is mounted (bind) in the folder 'shared-container-files' at the host, you can therefor update in the Host or in the container (for the location see the docker file: Dockerfile_Apache_PHP_cont) Edit the file(Unix EOL) and make sure the line with:
-- **/usr/sbin/php-fpm8.2 -F &** is changed  to:
-- **/usr/sbin/php-fpm5.6 -F &** (change the numbers to to the version you require) <br><br>
- Update the ***httpd-vhosts.conf*** shell script, this is mounted (bind) in the folder 'shared-container-files' at the host. Edit the file(Unix EOL) and make sure the line with:

```
SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
# is changed to:
SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php5.6-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/
```
(You could also first check if the file:  ```ls /run/php/php5.6-fpm.sock``` exists, this should be done by the php5.6-fpm package) <br><br>
- While this should be enough you can also execute the following command, to make sure the shell command **'php -v'** will return(and thus uses) your installed version as default.

```update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php5.6 # use which php5.6 to find this location```   
- Restart the container (restart Apache2 is not sufficient!)
