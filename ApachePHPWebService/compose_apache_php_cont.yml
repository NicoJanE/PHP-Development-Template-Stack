# 1) Explanation 'external'
# external: false â†’ Docker Compose creates the network automatically using IP defined in .env
#
# Changes this to 'true' in case you need other in depended (defined in other compose files)  Docker-services
# to access the service defined here. In that case you need:
#
#   1) Set the name network name(php_network) also in the other Docker compose file 
#   2) Set the external in the other compose file to true
#   3) Use the same network Subnets(defined in .env file) in both services
#   4) start network manually before starting any of the services (make sure to use the correct sub network)
#
#       Example: docker network create --subnet=${FIXED_SUBNET} php_network
#
#   Test if both are on the same network: docker network inspect php_network
#   To Test the used IP address inside the container enter: hostname -I

#           *** WARNING 1 ****
#           Don't use a bind mount to your Symfony project directory in Windows host. It is
#           horrible slow (+/-10 second to load simple page, none cached page)
#           You can use the '/shared-host'bind mount to copy your project(as backup) to the Windows host instead
#
#            - "D:\\Php\\Projects\\Mine\\Wiki-store\\project-php-app:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs"  # Bind mount the APP in htdocs which includes 'public'(is the www root)
