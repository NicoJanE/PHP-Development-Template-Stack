#
#   Some notes regarding chaining:
#   NOTE 1
#   - Bind mounts don't carry over, you have to specify them again
#   - same counts for network and pretty much all items
#   - So better to use a common compose file and let the other compose files extend from the items (like we done see extends: )

networks:
  php_network:                                  # Define a network, Changes this in case of external: true
    external: false                             # See 1) explanation below
    name: php_network_intern
    driver: bridge 
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: ${FIXED_SUBNET}
#
# 1) Explanation 'external'
# external: false â†’ Docker Compose creates the network automatically using IP defined in .env
#
# Changes this to 'true' in case you need other in depended (defined in other compose files)  Docker-services
# to access the service defined here. In that case you need:
#
#   1) Set the name network name(php_network) also in the other Docker compose file 
#   2) Set the external in the other compose file to true
#   3) Use the same network Subnets(defined in .env file) in both services
#   4) start network manually before starting any of the services (make sure to use the correct sub network)
#
#       Example: docker network create --subnet=${FIXED_SUBNET} php_network
#
#   Test if both are on the same network: docker network inspect php_network
#   To Test the used IP address inside the container enter: hostname -I
#
