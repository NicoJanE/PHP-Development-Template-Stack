This is a sample Symphony which belongs to the documentation that can be found in the **Howtos** folder under the name: ***Symfony-getting-started.md***
It is based on the SymfonyCast course Symfony 7 and it tries to example in a short as possible the the Symfony concepts.

To work with this update the document root folder in: ***/usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf***
Set it to: **/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/symfony-apps/Sample/public**
