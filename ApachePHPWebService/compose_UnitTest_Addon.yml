#	Extending/Chaining 
#	Installs PHPunit test environment in the docker image:''
#
#   Some notes regarding chaining:
#   NOTE 1
#   - Bind mounts don't carry over, you have to specify them again
#   - same counts for network and pretty much all items
#   - So better to use a common compose file and let the other compose files extend from items(like we done see extends: )

networks:
  php_network:                              # Define a network


services:
  webserver-apache-php:                     # Same name as base file!
    extends: 
      file: compose_apache_php_cont.yml     # our base compose file, see NOTE 1
      service: webserver-apache-php         # Same name as base file!
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile_UnitTest_Addon
    image: eelhart/apachephpweb:latest      # This name can be used to extend or chain this image.


# End compose file 


# build with:
#
# docker compose -f compose_UnitTest_Addon.yml up -d --remove-orphans
# docker  compose -f compose_UnitTest_Addon.yml up -d  --remove-orphans --build --force-recreate
